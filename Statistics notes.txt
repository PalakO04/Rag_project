Statistics notes
variance is directly associated with the spread of data
more the variance more spread is the data

Percentile:
It is the value below which certain percentage of observations lie
Example:
percentile of x = (No. of observations below x/ total no of observations) x 100

Index Position = (percentile / 100) x (n+1)

IQR
lower fence = Q1 - 1.5(IQR)
Upper fence = Q3 + 1.5(IQR)
Q1 = 25%
Q3 = 75%
IQR = Q3 - Q1

Boxplot is plotted based on these five points

Normal distribution
Empirical formula : 68-95-99.7% 
Within the first standard deviation 68% of data gets covered and likewise for other std deviations.
normal distribution has mean = 0 and std deviation = 1.

Z score formula:
(xi - u)/std dev
I we apply z score to the normal/gaussian distribution it becomes standard normal distribution.
This conversion is known as standardization.

Minmax scaler
converts values to 0 and 1


Probability
Mutually exclusive events:
Events that cannot occur together.

Non mutually exclusive events:
Events that can occur together.

Addition rule:
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Multiplication rule for independent events:
P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)

Multiplication rule for dependent events:
P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)

Permutation formula:
nPr = n!/(n - r)!

Combination formula:
nCr = n!/r!(n-r)!

Hypothesis Testing
Type1 error:
We reject the null hypothesis when in reality it is true.

Type2 error:
We accept the null hypothesis when in reality it is false.

Point Estimate:
The value of any statistics that estimates the value of a parameter.

Sample mean = xbar
Population mean = Mu

Confidence interval: Point estimate +- margin of error.

Z test is applied if population std dev is known else T test is applied.

Chi square test
It is a test that claims about population proportions.
It is a non parametric test that is performed on the categorical data(nominal or ordinal) data.

Covariance
P value < significance value --> Reject or accept null hypothesis
Cov(x,y) = sum(xi - xbar)(yi - ybar)/N

Pearson Correlation coefficient:
More the value is near 1 it is more positive correlation
The more towards -1 more it is negatively correlated
r= n(∑xy)−(∑x)(∑y)/[n∑x2−(∑x)2][n∑y2−(∑y)2]
=cov(x,y)/std dev(x).std dev(y)

Spearman rank = cov(x,y)/Rank(stddevx).Rstddev(y)
